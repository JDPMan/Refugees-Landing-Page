				<p class="h1 sectionTitle">Problem Statement</h1>
				<p class="descriptiveParagraph">Great Europe Missions (GEM) organize and manage refugee camps to serve those displaced from their home. In order to maximize efficiency and manage resources, a new system must be put in place to validate and authorize a refugee in order for them to be given supplies. Often people will go through a supply distribution line more than once to take extra resources that may be sold on the black market. In order to provide a fair experience for everyone and reduce additional supply costs for GEM, a system must be put in place to verify an individual and only allow one visit to each line. This will be done by taking a biometric hash of the refugee, and requiring that they be verified before passing through any line.</p>
