			<p class="h3 sectionTitle">Problem Statement</p>
			<div class="container">
				<p class="descriptiveParagraph">Greater Europe Missions (GEM) organize and manage refugee camps to serve those displaced from their home. In order to maximize efficiency and manage resources, a new system must be put in place to validate and authorize a refugee in order for them to be given supplies. Often people will go through a supply distribution line more than once to take extra resources that may be sold on the black market. In order to provide a fair experience for everyone and reduce additional supply costs for GEM, a system must be put in place to verify an individual and only allow one visit to each line. This will be done by taking a biometric hash of the refugee, and requiring that they be verified before passing through any line.</p>

			<p class="h3 sectionTitle">Intended Use & Audience</p>
			<div class="container">
				<p class="descriptiveParagraph">This product seeks to provide a dependable system to be used by GEM volunteers and Nongovernment Organizations working with refugees in Greece, although this product can be used in refugee camps across the globe. This sytem will be used to store digital credentials that will aid workers in determining how much supplies should be issued to each refugee and their families.</p>

						<p class="h3">Refugee Authentication</p>
						<p class="left">Refugees are authenticated upon entry to a supply line using biometric identification. This way, nobody can impersonate another and steal access to supplies, protecting supply access privileges for every individual.</p>
						<p class="h3">Personalized Eligibility</p>
						<p class="left">Refugee access history is stored such that camp volunteers are able to see whether or not a candidate refugee is eligible for a given supply. More factors such as the number of family members, allergies and specific clothing sizes may be integrated to create personalized refugee profiles.</p>
						<p class="h3">Supply Tracking</p>
						<p class="left">Using this product, NGOs will be able to track the quantity of people entering supply lines and compare this to the needs of individuals. If less people receive a given supply type than needed, this tool can help them identify those in need.</p>
						<p class="h3">User-Friendly Interface</p>
						<p class="left">The application is designed to be usable by people from various backgrounds speaking various languages. The app principally relies on icons and a streamlined interface to break the linguistic barrier and provide a smooth experience for volunteers and end-users.</p>
						<p class="h3">Bluetooth Synchronization</p>
						<p class="left">Considering the lack of wi-fi connectivity, the application is designed to synchronize with a hub in order to update internal tables pertaining to refugee accesses.</p>
